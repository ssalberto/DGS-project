# DGS-project
DGS database project

In the ./files directory are the test.vcf and the annotated files. (the clinvar.vcf is not inside because it is too heavy)

In the ./scripts are the scripts I used to do each step:
- download.py
- annotate.py
- csvCreation.py
- sqlTables.py
- sqlTablesData.py

The script annotate is suposed to work with the files of snpEff located in a directory called ./snpEff in the main folder which I didn't include because github didn't allow me.
